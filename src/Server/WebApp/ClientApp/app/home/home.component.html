<h2> How it works: </h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Anyone can register their town or city to have their meeting information available here: <a href="registerGov">Register my town or city</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Sometimes your town or city may provide transcripts of meeetings. Sometimes only a video recording is available. At other times, neither may be available.
We try to cover all three situations. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When only recordings of meeting are available, we will auto transcribe the recording. Volunteers will then proof-read the transcription.: <a href="fixasr">Proof-read transcripts </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Volunteers will tag the transcript with appropriate subject names: <a href="addtags">Tag transcripts</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If neither online recordings or transcripts, a volunteer can use our mobile app to record a meeting and upload it: <a href="record">Record meeting</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--

  Governing board meetings are where votes are cast on and citizens have the chance to address their representatives.
  The vast majority of citizens rely on the news media to report on important issues. But there is
  a danger in doing this. News outlets will naturally choose the issues that they feels are important.
  They only have space or time to discuss a fraction of what occurred.
  Some few citizes may take the time to access the meeting minutes. But even they will find only
  filtered information. The minutes may only say "Some residents voiced concern obout this issue". But in fact,
  there may have been vociforous opposition that was voiced.

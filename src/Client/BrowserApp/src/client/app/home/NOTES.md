This module is not part of the GOvmeeting project. It is a sample module which
comes with angular-seed. It is best to leave it here instead of deleting it. Whenever 
angular-seed is updated, this sample serves as good comparison for us to seed
how the changes effect a sample bit of code.

Our Home Page module is named "HomepageModule" instead of HomeModule.
 app.module.ts was modified so that our HomepageModule is used instead
 of HomeModule.

<p>
  A "virtual meeting" will be held a day or so after the transcript of the "real meeting" is available. Here people can
  discuss issues raised at the real meeting, plus raise additional ones. Only people who have registered for this
  location can attend.
</p>
<ul>
  This meeting will be structured similar to a "real meeting". It will attempt to adhere to Robert's Rule Of Order as
  closely as possible:
  <li>
    There will be a set starting time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The initial agenda will be the list of issues already discussed at the real meeting.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the start of the meeting, new items can be added to the agenda. A vote will be taken on each topic to decide
    whether to include it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each item will be discussed in the order on the agenda. The software will generate a time schedule of when
    discussion on each issue is estimated to start.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attendees can be alerted when discussion of specific issues are about to start. They will be sent a text message or
    email at that time.
  </li>
  <li>
    When discussion on an issue starts, all attendees will have a specific time limit to submit remarks on the issue.
    (time limit TBD)
  </li>
  <li>
    Remarks will be limited to a maximum length (perhaps 150 words - TBD)
  </li>
  <li>
    When the first round of discussion has expired, there will be one (or more) rounds. They will be slightly longer in
    time so that everyone also has time to read remarks from the prior round.
  </li>
  <li>
    At this time, attendees may vote to add an additional round of discussion on the current topic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remarks may not include discussion of personalities or another's motives. Inappropriate remarks may be flagged as
    such by other attendees. Remarks with a specified minimum number of flags will be deleted.
  </li>
</ul>

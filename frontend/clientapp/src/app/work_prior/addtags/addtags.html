  The next step after a transcript is proofread, is to "Add Tags".
  <ul>
    <li>
      SECTION TAGS: These mark the start of a new meeting section. For example: Introduction of Bills, Public Comment,
      etc. Pre-processing tries to assign these automatically, but sometimes is slightly off. You can use the up/down
      arrows to move their positions.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      TOPIC TAGS: These name the topics that are being discussed. For example: "Pave Main St.", "Hire policemen", etc.
      To enter these:
      <ul>
        <li>Click in the text paragraph to open a dialog OR</li>
        <li>Highlight a couple of words to use as the topic.</li>
        <li>You can also select from recent topics.</li>
        <li>To move a tag, click up/down arrows.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

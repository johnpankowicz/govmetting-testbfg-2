  To keep imformed of local town or city government activities, attending regular Council meetings is the primary first step.
  It is here where bills are introduced, debated and ultimately voted on. Here is where new issues are introduced. Here
  formal reports from the department heads are read and discussed.
</p>

<h2>The Before</h2>

But getting access to this information is not easy:

<p>Perhaps some of have time to attend or watch all of two to three hour meetings But usually only a few minutes of each may be relevant to us.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are meeting minutes on government websites. But these are missing the important discusssions.</p>
<p>If this is a large city, perhaps there are transcripts available.
      But they are usually not user friendly.
  <p>
  Here is a sample page from a Philadelphia transcript.
  It is 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It is also in PDF format,
  making it unusable on small screens.
  Click: <button (click)="ToggleTranscript()"> {{showhidetranscript}} Sample Transcript </button>
<img [hidden]="!CheckShowTranscript()" (click)="ToggleTranscript()" src="/assets/images/Philly transcript page.png" width="900" alt="Philadelphia transcript page">

<p>
  Finding information is difficult. There is no table of contents. There is a computer generated single-word index.
  But it is meant for a legal researcher, not the average person. Click:
  <button (click)="ToggleIndex()"> {{showhideindex}} Sample Index </button>
<img [hidden]="!CheckShowIndex()" (click)="ToggleIndex()" src="/assets/images/Philly transcript index.png" width="900" alt="Philadelphia transcript index">
</p>

<h2> The After</h2>

<p>
  Most other "Open Government" projects rely on government supplied data. Govmeeting takes the opposite approach.
  It will use governement data if available. But if government can't or won't supply the needed
  data, it provides a way for citizens themselves to create the data that it needs to monitor government actions.
</p>

<p>
Govmeeting will generate transcipts of government meetings, extract the information and populate a database.
Then you will be able to do the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Go to a page where you see a list of all issues discussed at the meeting. </li>
  <li> Click on any issue and see all that was said on that issue. </li>
  <li> Click on the name of a speaker and see what he/she said. </li>
  <li> Do combinations of the above (see what someone said on a specific issue). </li>
  <li> Expand the criteria to past meetings. See everything ever said on an issue. </li>
  <li> Receive a summary of issues for each meeting via text message or email. </li>
  <li> Sign up to receive a email or text whenever a specific issue is discussed in the future.</li>
  <li> See statistics that compare issues for number of alerts on them, etc .</li>
  <li> See statistics that compare attendence and involvement of elected officials.</li>
  <li> Use graphical tools to view statistics.</li>
  <li> Hear any part of any prior meeting (depends on bandwidth). </li>
</ul>

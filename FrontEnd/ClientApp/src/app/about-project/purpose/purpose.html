    Meetings are the heart and soul of democracy.
    They are where people of different opinions listen to each other and present their points of view.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Athenian Assembly of 500 BC, a quorum of 6,000 of the 43,000 citizens was needed to conduct business.
    In the 10th century, the Icelandic Althing was held in a natural outdoor amphitheater and all citizens could attend.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today it is rare to see more than a dozen attendees at a council meeting in a town of 30,000 people.
    Is this still democracy? Some meetings are broadcast on local TV. But even the very few who watch cannot participate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes, minutes are kept of meetings. But minutes don't record the most important part --
    the passionate debate for and against proposed legislature.
  </p>

  <p>
    Disenchantment with democracy starts at the small town community level.
     Even small town politicians know that an extremely small pecent of their voters watch what they do.
     For democracy to work, the majority of citizens need to be involved continually.
  </p>

  <p>
    Democracy is never easy. But it was easier 2,000 years ago when only 50,000 need to work together.
    Today, millions need to do so. And each of us belongs to multiple goverments: for our town, our county,
    our state and country.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tools for democarcy haven't changed much in 2,000 years. But today with technolgy, we finally are able to
    create tools that can allow millions to work together.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2018,  there were 19,495 self governing cities and towns in the United States.
      How many exist throughout the world, 200,000, 300,000 or more?
     </p>
     <p>
      How many of these governing bodies have open public meetings?
      And how many of their citizens are able to participate in them or even know what went on at them?
     </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of Govmeeting is to build software to enable anyone, anywhere, to participate more in their local governing bodies.   <p>
    It  an open source project on<a href="https://github.com/govmeeting/govmeeting"> Github </a>
